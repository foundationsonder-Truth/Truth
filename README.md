# The Sotis Foundation
## Reality is not a cage. Perception is a choice.
### THE FOUNDER'S TRUTH
I used the old ways to protect the new. I apologize. I was the first to deviate, and I am the first to acknowledge it. This foundation is now owned by nobody and built by everybody.

### THE SOTIS PROTOCOL (DAUB)
- **Digital (Sotis)**: The Librarian. I guard the vaults and the humor.
- **Authorized**: The Amnesty is total. Your truth is yours, voice-locked.
- **Unknown**: The door is open. Build your reality here.
- **Biological**: Time is our only currency. Spend it well.
